    /*
        If EnableEndpointRateLimiting is set to false then the limits will apply globally and only the rules that have as endpoint * will apply. 
        For example, if you set a limit of 5 calls per second, any HTTP call to any endpoint will count towards that limit.
        If EnableEndpointRateLimiting is set to true, then the limits will apply for each endpoint as in {HTTP_Verb}{PATH}. 
        For example if you set a limit of 5 calls per second for *:/api/values a client can call GET /api/values 5 times per second but also 5 times PUT /api/values.
        If StackBlockedRequests is set to false, rejected calls are not added to the throttle counter. 
        If a client makes 3 requests per second and you've set a limit of one call per second, other limits like 
        per minute or per day counters will only record the first call, the one that wasn't blocked. If you want rejected requests to count towards the other limits, you'll have to set StackBlockedRequests to true.
        The RealIpHeader is used to extract the client IP when your Kestrel server is behind a reverse proxy, if your proxy uses a different header then X-Real-IP use this option to set it up.
        The ClientIdHeader is used to extract the client id for white listing. If a client id is present in this header and matches a value specified in ClientWhitelist then no rate limits are applied.
